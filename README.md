# React Hooks

This is a small project comparing the Hooks way with the old class components way.
I wrote this code (albeit with fewer comments :sweat_smile:) live during a
Lunch and Learn I gave on Hooks. I thought it would be helpful if I cleaned it up
a bit and put it in a repo so anyone could look at it and learn if they wanted. :sparkles:

## Running

This is just a create-react-app project. Run with `yarn start`.
