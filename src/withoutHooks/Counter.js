  // the class properties proposal, but we would have to manually bind these
  // in the constructor otherwise.
  //
  // decrement, increment, and reset take advantage of the fact that React
  // does shallow merges of the existing state and the object returned from setState
  // One one hand, this allows only updating certain pieces of state
  // One the other hand, all the state is in the same `state` object
  // and it can be difficult and often verbose to work with.
  // Similar to Hooks, setState allows a callback and plain value form
